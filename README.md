# DiSH.cs

## Building
You can either wait for releases or compile yourself. To build, use Visual Studio. The .env template (put it in the DiSH.cs folder) is the same as the one in [the original DiSH](https://github.com/LDevs-Team/DiSH). There is also a publish template for .NET native (no framework)

## Running
Open it I guess, no loader needed
